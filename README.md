YouTube Trending Videos Analysis
YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top-of-the-line videos on the network. According to Variety magazine, "YouTube uses a range of variables
like calculating user interactions (number of downloads, shares, feedback and likes) to assess the year's top-trend videos. Remember that they are not the most watched videos 
for the calendar year as a whole. The top performers on the YouTube trend list are music videos (such as the virile "Gangam Style"), celebrity and/or reality videos.
TV output,and the crazy dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well known for. The dataset I use is This is a regular archive of the top-of-the-line YouTube videos.
Includes several months (and counting) of data on average YouTube videos trending. Statistics are used in the U.S., GB, DE, CA, RU, MX, KR, JP, IN and FR areas (U.S., United Kingdom,
Britain, Canada , Russia, China , South Korea, Japan , India and France, respectively, with up to 200 trend-setting videos a day. The data for every area is in a separate tab.
Data includes video title, channel title, time-publishing, tags, comments, likes and dislikes, definition, and comment count.

Possible uses for this dataset could include:
Study of sentiment in a number of ways
Categorizing YouTube videos on the basis of their feedback and statistics.
Training ML algorithms such as RNNs to create their own YouTube comments.
Analyzing what factors influence how famous a YouTube video is going to be.
Statistic analysis over time


I'm going to consider some details like:
What's the most common form of video?
Distribution of opinions, likes, feedback is equal for all category's?
Should we have a normal distribution of values?
Which are the most common names in title, definition, tags?
